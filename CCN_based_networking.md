## CCN Traffic Optimization for IoT [5]

All the smart applications rely on contextual information, like geographical location, temperature, and other physical information for their working. This information is produced by sensors in the device. Hence, the study of communication of sensors is of critical importance today. The communication of sensors is significantly different from the common usage of internet today, in the fact that they are short-lived, push-based and have small contents.

Sensors can produce information in two ways - on demand (when requested by another entity), or proactively send it to the data-consumers on a periodoc basis. Sensors communicate using Wireless Sensor Networks(WSN) which are connected to the internet  through gateways. Optimal network protocols for IoT devices is an active area of research, although there are de-facto industry standards.

The major types of routing followed in WSNs are : data-centric and hierarchical.
In hierarchical routing, a leader among the devices is elected, who serves as a proxy for data communication. In data-centric routing, communication happens through hop-by-hop communication. This paper advocates the usage of Content-Centric Networking(CCN), because it is supported on a majority of mobile devices and computers(CCNx), and also by sensors running on Contiki. CCN combines the merits of both hierarchical and data-oriented approaches by using a scalabale hierarchical naming scheme, and integrates the security and caching by it's design.
