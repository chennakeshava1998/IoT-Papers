### Ravel: Programming IoT Applications as Distributed Models, Views, and Controllers [12]

IoT is bringing in the next technological revolution of the 21st century.
Many of these IoT systems are modelled as complex distributed systems, and they share a 3-tier architecture consisting of embedded nodes, gateways that connect an embedded network to the wider Internet and data services in servers or the cloud. Yet the IoT applications are developed for each tier separately. Consequently, the developer needs to amalgamate these distinct applications together. This paper proposes a novel approach for programming applications across 3-tiers using a distributed extension of the Model-View-Controller architecture. The main advantages of going with this approach are - automatic model synchronization, data transport, and energy efficiency.

This paper presented Ravel, a novel programming framework allowing developers to program 3-tier architecture explicitly in a manner very similar to web applications today, via models, views, and controllers. Ravel introduces concept of space, which bind particular models, controllers and views to a specific devices. The networking complexities between devices are hidden by the distributed model that automatically synchronizes whenever possible. Ravel suggests that perhaps we should consider programming at an even larger scale, encompassing the gateways and cloud that are part of almost every application.
