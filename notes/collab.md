### A Framework for Building a Collaborative Environment in an Open IoT Platform [15]

When developing IoT Objects, collaboration is very important in all types of projects. However, existing IoT platforms do not support a collaborative environment between users. Thus, this paper proposes a collaborative environment that can enable users to co-work by sharing diverse ideas and data. This paper proposes a framework for a collaborative environment that enables people to collaboratively develop IoT-based objects based on an open IoT platform. This framework for collaborative environments provides new ways of working.

In this paper, they have presented a framework for collaboration environments based on an open IoT platform. For effective collaboration in developing IoT objects, the open IoT platform needs to have a structure that can systematically record, manage, and match the processes of each development. This framework for collaborative environments will play an important role in providing new ways of working and new ways of service.
