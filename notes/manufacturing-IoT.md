#### Real-time Data Driven Monitoring and Optimization Method for loT -based Sensible Production Process [8]

The productivity of the manufacturing process is hampered by the lack of timely and accurate information about the dynamic changes happening on the floor of the assembly line. Advances in IoT and Ubiquitous Computing has given the capability to embed sensors inside the different components used in manufacturing, and enable real-time sensing and actuation based on the data. This improves productivity, cuts costs, improves the efficiency of the process, cuts the logistics cost, etc.

This paper discusses a conceptual Wireless Manufacturing (WM) using the data collected by all the RFID tags throughout the supply chain. This data is then used to make decisions dynamically, in real-time. This type of a system has already been developed for a Grocery chain, by a Spanish company Ecomovistand. 

Some of the challenges faced in using IoT in manufacturing systems are:
1. Development of a comprehensive IoT architecture for the entire supply chain.
2. Interpreting and analysing the vast amount of distributed data being supplied from different components in the manufacturing system.
3. Enforcing real-time optimization routines in certain parts of the suppy-chain, based on real-time data?
This paper attempts to solve these challenges, with a special focus on the optimization strategies.

This paper makes four important contributions in achieving this aim:
1. Development of the architecture for the IoT manufacturing process. An integral part of this architecture is to embed the RFID/Auto-ID tags into certain key components.
2. Enable sensors in the manufacturig side, so that the manufacturers can produce items in a smart way - this includes enabling communication between devices and encoding certain logic for the production systems.
3. The third contribution is in analysing the data obtained from the distributed sensors present in many components. This methodology helps obtain useful and interpretable information, from the raw data.
4. The fourth contribution is in the dynamic optimization of the manufacturing process, by making use of real-time data.
