#### IoT Based Smart Rehabilitation System [9]

IoT has enabled the interconnection of many devices through the internet. IoT becomes especially useful in cases of an aging population and an acute shortage of healthcare professionals. Although it IoT has been experimented with in this area, some challenges prove to be obstacles from acheiving rapid answers to a patient's symptoms and needs. This paper proposes to address this through Ontology-abased Automatic Design Methdology(ADM). 

The average age of the population tends towards to be over 50 for many of the countries. The rehabilitation of the elderly is an important concern as it requires the enery, resources and manpower of the society. Community facilitation for rehabilitation aims to provide better interaction, adequate resources and timely solutions to every patient's individual needs tailored to every patient's individual requirements, better than the services offered by a hospital. This idea is achieved through the IoT devices, which provide the important ability of interaction between many sensors and actuators.

The usage of IoT can indeed bring in a huge amount of information from the numerous sensors used, and increases the complexity of the system by a large amount. Also, the data in itself is not sufficient in solving the intended problems. Hence two key challenges exist in this scenario:
1.  Quick diagnnosis of the patient ( by identifying the symptoms )
2.  Enforcing a quick rehabilitation strategy and identifying/procuring the medical resouces based on the diagnosis.

This paper aims to construct an architecture/design system for efficient sharing of information across all devices. The success of preliminary tests indicate that larger, real-world tests need to be conducted in order to test the efficacy of this system.
