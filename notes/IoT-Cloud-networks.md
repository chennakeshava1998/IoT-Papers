#### IoT-Cloud Service Optimization in Next Generation Smart Environments [10]

IoT technology can only reach it's potential if we can optimise the combined usage of IoT and Cloud services. Today, the workflow of most of the services involve sending all of the data from sensors/devices to a centralised cloud, where processing of the data is performed. But this obviously brings in disadvantages like increased latency, higher power consumption, huge network load, etc. But advances in network virtualization, distributed cloud-network architectures are being improved upon to solve this problem. In this paper, this problem is mathematically modelled as the minimum-cost mixed cast problem, and it is shown to be efficiently solved using linear programming.

In order to maintain the stringent QoS requirements, distributed cloud architectures are being increasingly used. Some examples are cloudlets, micro-clouds, fog-clouds, etc where each of these components are present at the edge of the network and have varying degrees of compute, storage and other resources. Today, even some of the end IoT devices are being used to provide varying degress of these capabilities, by expoiting high degree of virtualization layers in the device. This has helped in decreasing latencies and other related problems. This type of interconnection of cloud and IoT devices has been referred to as Cloud-IoT network.

In these types of virtualised environments, all the services use the virtual-slices of resources, as per the demand. So a critical component of such a system is in efficient routing of the resource-requests sticking to the constraints and simultaneously maintaining the efficiency.
