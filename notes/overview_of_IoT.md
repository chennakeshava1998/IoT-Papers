### Internet of Things (IoT): A vision, architectural elements, and future directions [6]

Smart connectivity to the existing networks, and context-aware usage of network resources is an important part of IoT infrastructure. IoT technology is vastly influenced by the devices that communicate with open-wireless networks like Wifi, Bluetooth, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), etc. IoT devices are used for sensing and harvesting/collecting data from the environment, and it is used to  communicate with the actuator nodes, which perform certain actions in the environment.

**Ubiquitous Computing:** Mark Weiser, who is considered as the father of the modern field of ubiquitous computing, defined smart environment where the sensors, actuators and other computing devices which are seamlessly integrated into the environment of the user in a non-pervasive manner. This is a generic, 'calm computing' approach. On the other hand, Rogers proposed a domain-specific approach to ubiquitous computing, where the organizations can heap the maximum benefit by customising the usage of ubiquitous computing. Caceres and Friday attribute Cloud-Computing and IoT as the two most critical technologies in enabling Uniquitous Computing [7]

The advancements in Micro-Electronic Mechanical Systems (MEMS) has resulted in the development of low-power devices, which can sense, compute, and communicate data with other devices of the same nature. These types of devices form Wireless Sensor Network(WSN), which finds applications in delicate ecological and environment monitoring, healthcare, traffic monitoring, retail, etc. 

Cloud computing provides a secure, scalable and efficient storage for the vast swathes of data produced by the innumerable sensors. Apart from storage of data, the compute resources provided by the cloud infrastructure is used for performing analysis/processing on the data produced by the sensors and enabling visualization of data through web-based tools.



This paper presents a comprehensivee study on the advancements of IoT since it's inception, the various applications/fields poised to benifit the most from IoT, the challenges faced by Cloud-based IoT, the inter-disciplinary technologies that need to converge in order to overcome some of the challenges, etc are discussed in this paper.
