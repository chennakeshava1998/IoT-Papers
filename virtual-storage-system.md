### Virtual Storage System based on Multiple Embedded Devices in IoT Environments

The paper proposes a virtual storage system based on the multiple embedded devices in IoT environments, which builds the storage by reusing the remaining storage space of the existing embedded devices. The virtual storage system consists of a client, a gateway and multiple embedded devices. The client transmits various types of data to the gateway. The gateway divides the data transmitted from the client as the multiple blocks, and then transmits each block considering the remaining storage space of the embedded devices. The embedded device stores the blocks transmitted from the gateway or returns the current storage information.

This paper presents the virtual storage system based on the multiple embedded devices in IoT environments. The proposed system is designed to reuse the remaining storage space of the multiple embedded devices for storing the clientâ€™s data. We implement the proposed system by using the Raspberry Pi3 to evaluate the feasibility and scalability.
